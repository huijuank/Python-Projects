In this repo, I collated some of the past Python projects I have done.

## OpenCV

### Overlay_CameraImage_Heatmap.py
In this code, I created a class to implement the overlay of a camera image and a heatmap graph. 

This is useful in a case whereby one have collated experimental data of a specific device, and would like to have a better visualisation of the data with respect to the device. By overlaying the heatmap graph onto a camera image of the device, one can directly infer which parts of the device correlates to specific parts of the heatmap graph.
