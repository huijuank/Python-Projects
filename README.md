# Python-Projects

In this repo, I collated some of the past Python projects I have done.

## OpenCV

### Overlay_CameraImage_Heatmap.py
#### Libraries used: OpenCV on Python
##### Project: Internship
In this code, I created a class to implement the overlay of a camera image and a heatmap graph. 

This is useful in a case whereby one have collated experimental data of a specific device, and would like to have a better visualisation of the data with respect to the device. By overlaying the heatmap graph onto a camera image of the device, one can directly infer which parts of the device correlates to specific parts of the heatmap graph.

### Overlay_CameraImage_Heatmap.py
#### Libraries used: Matplotlib, Numpy, PySimpleGUI
##### Project: Internship
In this code, I created a function which loads CSV files and plot the data. There is the option to:
1. normalize the data
2. convert the data to logarithmic scale

This is useful for processing of given data to assist in data analysis works.

There is a line of code which is has a command for some output in PySimpleGUI, as this is one of the post processing features which I have added on to an application used in my internship.
